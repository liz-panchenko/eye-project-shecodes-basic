                        It is believed that blue eyes didnâ€™t start showing up
                        until about 6,000 years ago when a genetic mutation
                        developed that led to blue eyes. That means that all
                        blue-eyed people are related. Brown is still the most
                        common eye colour (approximately 79% of the worldâ€™s
                        population has been recorded to have brown eyes).

                        Our eyes can distinguish over 500 shades of grey,
                        meanwhile are able to recognise only three colours: red,
                        blue and green. All other colours are a mix of the
                        three.
                        <br />2 percent of women have a rare mutation that
                        allows them to see 100 million colours with the help of
                        an extra membrane on their retina. 1 in 12 men do not
                        distinguish colours.

                        Images arrive at your eye upside-down, split in half and
                        distorted. Your brain flips the image for you so
                        naturally that you're perceiving everything right side
                        up. Plus, images start divided in half and distorted as
                        each one of your eyes perceives the world. Your brain
                        then goes to work pairing the images together to give
                        you one, clean panoramic view.

              disappear.

            The effect is a good way to demonstrate what is known as
            motion-induced blindness (MIB)â€”a phenomenon in which motionless
            elements disappear in front of an observerâ€™s eyes when masked with a
            moving background.
